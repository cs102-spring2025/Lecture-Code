•	Data hiding is a fundamental concept of OOP.

•	It restricts the access of private members from outside the class.

•	Sometimes you have functions that do not belong to the class (defined outside that class scope) 
    but need access to some private or protected members of the class.

•	A friend function can access private and protected data of a class.

•	We declare a friend function using the friend keyword inside the body of the class. 


class className {
     ... ... ...
     friend returnType function_name(arguments)
     ... ... ...
}
